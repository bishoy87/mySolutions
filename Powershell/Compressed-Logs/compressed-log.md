**This script can be used in scenarios where log management and archival are required. It helps in organizing log data by dates, reducing the size of logs by compressing them, and cleaning up old logs to save disk space. This can be particularly useful in environments with large and frequently updated log files, where efficient log management is crucial for system performance and maintenance**
